<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
<h3>1. Game Setup:</h3>

<h3>2. Taking Turns:</h3>
<li>The player assigned X goes first, followed by the O player.</li>
<li>Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in one of the empty squares.</li>
<h3>3. Winning the Game:</h3>
<p>A player wins if they place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. Specifically:</p>

<li>A horizontal row (three X’s or O’s across any row).</li>
<li>A vertical column (three X’s or O’s down any column).</li>
<li>A diagonal (either from top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left).</li>
<h3>4. Tying the Game:</h3>
