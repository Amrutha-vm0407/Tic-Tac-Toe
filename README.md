<h1>Tic Tac Toe Game</h1>
The game is structured using HTML with a 3Ã—3 grid of input fields representing the Tic Tac Toe board. Each cell is an input element, and there's a reset button to new game button. Basic CSS is applied to style the grid, ensuring each cell appears as a square, and visually arranging the grid. JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The collaborative orchestration of frontend technologies converges into a user-friendly and intuitive game interface.
